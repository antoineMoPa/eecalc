# eecalc

eecalc is a multi-user math web app. The math syntax is parsed in the browser by [math.js](http://mathjs.org/).

[Live demo](http://a-mo-pa.com:3000/sheet/demo)

# Example

    sin(45 deg) => 0.7071067811865475

# Code

A node.js backend with socket.io is used for synchronisation of sheets between multiple users.
The client UI is mostly written in vanilla JS. No jQuery, no angular, no react, no whatever (for now).
